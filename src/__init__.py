# collector only when the web UI process imported src.web.application. The
# packaged scheduler runs in DiscountParserWorker.exe and therefore collected
# sites with the unpatched GenericWebCollector while Telegram still worked.
# Install both website extraction layers here so UI, worker, bot and CLI share
# exactly the same collector behavior.

# the five customer sources use their dedicated adapters as production decoders
